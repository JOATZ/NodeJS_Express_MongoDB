This repository is part of a bootcamp curriculum focusing on NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express. It contains several subfolders with projects that showcase the use of these technologies along with others to build various applications. Below is a synopsis of the different technologies used across these projects:

-   **NodeJS**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's used across all projects for server-side logic.
-   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store data. It's directly utilized in projects within the `node-mongo` and `node-mongoose` folders.
-   **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's used in the `node-express`, `nucampsiteServer`, and `nucampsiteServerGCP` projects.
-   **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. It's utilized in the `node-mongoose` and `nucampsiteServer` projects.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used in the `nucampsiteClientGCP` project to create the front-end.
-   **Other Technologies**: Various other libraries and middleware are used across the projects, including but not limited to `morgan` for HTTP request logging, `cors` for enabling CORS, `passport` for authentication, and `express-session` for session management.

Each subfolder represents a project that focuses on specific aspects of web development using these technologies. The `package.json` files within these folders list all dependencies and provide a clear overview of the technologies and libraries used.
